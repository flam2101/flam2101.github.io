      <h3>Personal Top 3 One Piece Characters</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <figure id="one">
            <img src="Shanks.jpg" alt="Shanks" style="width:15%">
            <figcaption>Shanks</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Reason: Shanks is one of the strongest characters in One piece, yet he's full of mysteries. No one knows
            what he is truly capable of in a serious fight. Also, he is a kind and loyal captain to his crew.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <figure id="two">
            <img src="Yamato.jpg" alt="Yamato" style="width:15%">
            <figcaption>Yamato</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Reason: Yamato is the daughter of one of the four Emperors of the sea. She is already strong as it is, but
            what I like the most about her is that she was a fierce warrior in her fights and her goal was to protect
            the people of
            Wano.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <figure id="three">
            <img src="Mihawk.jpg" alt="Mihawk" style="width:15%">
            <figcaption>Mihawk</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Reason: Just like shanks Dracule Mihawk is an extremely powerful, but mysterious character. He does hold the
            title "The World's Strongest Swordsman". He also seems to have a rivalry with Shanks.
